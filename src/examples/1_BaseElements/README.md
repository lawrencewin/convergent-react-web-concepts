An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
Examples of some HTML elements:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

The basic elements of an HTML page are:

A text header, denoted using the <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6> tags.
A paragraph, denoted using the <p> tag.
A horizontal ruler, denoted using the <hr> tag.
A link, denoted using the <a> (anchor) tag.
A list, denoted using the <ul> (unordered list), <ol> (ordered list) and <li> (list element) tags.
An image, denoted using the <img> tag
A divider, denoted using the <div> tag
A text span, denoted using the <span> tag

1. <h1></h1> 
   This is a heading tag, which creates a title by making text bigger and making it bold. There are six heading tags: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, in descending order of size.

2. <p></p> 
   This tag specifies that a given section is supposed to be its own paragraph. Browsers usually insert blank spaces between paragraphs, making the text easier to read.

3. <a></a>
   This tag let’s us create a link with its ‘href’ attribute, like so:

<a href=www.somewebsite.com>Click here</a>.

4. <img></img>
   The ‘image’ tag is how you insert images into a web page.

5. <div></div> 
   Div tags group multiple pieces of content into a single container, which allows you to do things like apply separate styling to just that content

6. <span></span>
   Span is like a smaller version of div, used to style or interact with inline content. You could add just a couple of words to a particular class (<span class=’endorsement’>Text</span>) which, again, is great for styling and making the content more responsive.

Each element can also have attributes - each element has a different set of attributes relevant to the element. There are a few global elements, the most common of them are:

id - Denotes the unique ID of an element in a page. Used for locating elements by using links, JavaScript, and more.
class - Denotes the CSS class of an element. Explained in the CSS Basics tutorial.
style - Denotes the CSS styles to apply to an element. Explained in the CSS Basics tutorial.
data-x attributes - A general prefix for attributes that store raw information for programmatic purposes. Explained in detailed in the Data Attributes section.
